Writing here.

ENUMs are constants and not strings! 

Library:

list of books done via enum? but we can update the list so is this the best way to store books?

user needs to ask for a book;
program checks whether the book is available or exists in the library;
then, program checks whether the book is available for borrowing;
then, a user gets the book and it is unavailable anymore;

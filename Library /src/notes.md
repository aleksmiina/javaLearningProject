pushing the code (as usual):

git add .
git commit -m "Updates in code"
git push


ENUMs are constants and not strings! 

Library:

- list of books will be done via a List (done for the moment)

- user needs to ask for a book; (now I need to compare user's input to the book list)
- program checks whether the book is available or exists in the library;
- then, program checks whether the book is available for borrowing;
- then, a user gets the book and it is unavailable anymore;

To do:

1. I want to print out all the available books to a user in order he could choose one.
    1.1. There is some issue with the override which I need to get into later
